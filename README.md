# Rust Starters

This repo holds the source to a page which helps new contributors identify
introductory Rust issues. If you have a problem with Rust itself, please
[file a bug there](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-reports).

## Installing dependencies

NPM is used to manage testing dependencies. `npm install` is required if you
are going to run the tests.

## Running JS Hint

To try and enforce good JS practice, please ensure that running `npm test`
passes when making changes to the codebase.
